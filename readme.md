# Data Structure and Algo Repo

## Small Introduction
This is my learning journey where I will learn from basic **Data Structures and Algorithms** to some intermediate level.

## Goal of Doing This

The main goal is to develop the intuition to solve real-life problems algorithmically and efficiently. This will help me become more intuitive, ace coding interviews that focus on DSA, and sharpen my mind.

## Steps and Algorithms

I will start with basic sorting algorithms, then move to Data Structures, and later explore some ML algorithms.
